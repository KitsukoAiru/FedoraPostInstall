# FedoraPostInstall
This is a little script for Fedora as a Post Install script, installing the commonly used codecs, adding the RPMFusion repos and the good Flatpak repo, its just that.

# Running the script
Use command "sudo chmod +x" then tab to give perms to the script
Then use "sudo ./" to run the script, the code is made to auto accept the installation so you only need to run it and sit tight.

# Editing
You can edit the file with the apps and/or repos you need or want, just open the .sh with your text editor of preference and copy the commands to the file, remember to add "-y" to auto accept.

Enjoy this script, anything you feel to be added to the repo let me know.
